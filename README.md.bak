Tech Stack:
	Front-end :- html5,css3,javascript,jquery;
	back-end :- jsp;
	database :- oracle 11g express;

Note:-
	As we have used jsp, we need to have tomcat server installed on our device to run jsp pages.
	and oracle 11g express also should be installed;
	
Initial steps (mandatory):

	After installing oracle database,
	create a new user named "mohan" with password "root" and grant him all privileges,
	by following the below steps,
		
		1) create user:
		
			CREATE USER mohan IDENTIFIED BY root;
		
		2) grant all privileges
		
			Grant all privileges to mohan;
			
	Now, connect to the database with user name "mohan" and password "root".
	
	Create a table named "ZOHOUSERS" using the following command
	
	CREATE TABLE ZOHOUSERS (
	
		email varchar(35) unique not null,
		password varchar(20),
		secretcode varchar(20),
		contactstable varchar(30) unique not null
		
	);

Now we are all set to run the Zoho contacts app (web Application).
